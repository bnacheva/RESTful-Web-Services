# ASP.NET Core RESTful Web Service Development

A RESTful Web service application in ASP.NET Core with separate controllers for GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests.
In the StudentRegistrationController class I have introduced four different types of POST services. The reason for introducing four 
different types of POST methods is to provide an example of using generic types as return type.
